The rectangular area of the game board starts filled with seven different colored gems. 
The only valid move is to swap adjacent gems to make three or more gems of the same 
color line up horizontally or vertically. When that happens, you earn points, the 
lined-up gems disappear, the gems above them fall and the extra space is filled with 
random gems. Once this has happened, there may once again be three or more gems lined 
up, in which case the process is repeated. The game ends when there are no valid moves. 

In the timed mode, all the above rules apply with a little twist: the progress through 
the level goes down faster and faster by each level, and when it reaches 0, the game 
is over.
